# YouTube Related Videos Enabler

An extension for Chromium based browsers (Brave, Edge, Chrome, Opera, Vilvadi, ...) that automatically enables/clicks the "Related" button in the Reccomended Videos when watching a YouTube video.

## Installation

Clone the repository to a local folder.

Enable "Developer Mode" in your browser's extension settings.

Load the local folder (using "Load Unpacked") in your brower's extension menu.

## Usage

This extension will automatically run whenever you are on a YouTube site.

## Known Bugs

The extension currently cannot detect when a new video loads, if another tab is focused, and the YouTube tab that's autoplaying/switching is in the background focus. This will be fixed in future iterations using Service Workers to allow the extentsion to run in the background.
